# 1. it will automatically build the required images
# 2. start the containers
# 3. create the linking between containers
# 4. it shall use Dockerfile internally no need to execute docker build command now
# 5. This file shall pull the mongo image & spawn the container for it at 27017
# 6. This file shall build the image for product-service & start the container at 5233
